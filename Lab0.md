## 1. Installation Method Chosen
I chose to install Ubuntu using **[VirtualBox]**.  

**Reasoning:**

The process was rather simple in itself, and not so tiring ðŸ‘Œ... but the most probable cause of stress in the whole process was minutes and minutes of loading screen of ubuntu.

What are two advantages of installing Ubuntu in VirtualBox?

### **Advantages of Installing Ubuntu in VirtualBox**

1. **Safety and Flexibility** â€” You donâ€™t risk messing with existing disk partitions or the main OS. If something goes wrong, you can just delete the VM and start fresh.
2. **Snapshots and Parallel Use** â€” VirtualBox allows you to take snapshots, roll back instantly, and run Ubuntu alongside Windows without rebooting.

What are two advantages of dual booting instead of using a VM?

### **Advantages of Dual Booting Instead of Using a VM**

1. **Full Hardware Performance** â€” Since Ubuntu runs directly on the machine, it uses 100% of CPU, GPU, and RAM, making it much faster than a VM (especially for resource-heavy tasks).
2. **Direct Hardware/Driver Access** â€” Dual boot avoids virtualization overhead and ensures proper support for drivers, graphics, and peripherals â€” ideal for gaming, graphics-intensive work, or networking.
